*Research Associate, University of Cambridge*

I am a Research Associate at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I lead a research project (funded by [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/)) on developing a benchmark for measuring the ability of LLMs to perform data science tasks. I am more broadly interested in [AI evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15620), particularly in [predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14445) and [cognitive evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06378), and I closely collaborate with [Prof José Hernández-Orallo](http://josephorallo.webs.upv.es/) and [Prof Lucy Cheke](http://lcfi.ac.uk/people/lucy-cheke/). I contribute to the [AI evaluation newsletter](https://aievaluation.substack.com/) and advise [RAND](https://www.rand.org/) on AI evaluation.

I am deeply familiar with EU AI policy (having been involved in several initiatives), and am one of the co-founders of the Italian AI policy think tank [CePTE](https://www.cepte.it/). I also collaborate with [The Unjournal](https://www.unjournal.org/) to make impactful research more rigorous, and I co-founded [AcademicJobsItaly.com](https://academicjobsitaly.com/) to make the Italian academic job market more accessible.

I previously worked on [detecting lying in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15840) with [Dr Owain Evans](https://owainevans.github.io/) (through the MATS programme) and on [technical standards for AI](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/standard-setting/) for the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) at the [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/).

I obtained a PhD in Statistics and Machine Learning at Oxford, during which I worked on Bayesian simulation-based inference, generative models and probabilistic forecasting (with applications to meteorology). My supervisors were Prof. [Ritabrata Dutta](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/) (Uni. Warwick) and Prof. [Geoff Nicholls](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/geoff-nicholls) (Uni. Oxford). 

Before my PhD studies, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Physical Engineering from Politecnico di Torino (Italy) and an MSc in Physics of Complex Systems from Politecnico di Torino and Université Paris-Sud, France. I did my MSc thesis at [LightOn](https://lighton.ai/), a machine learning startup in Paris.
